# Hello, I am Mohammed Bin Semaidaa

As it is written up there my name is Mohammed Bin Semaidaa, and I am half yemeni, and half finnish. 22 years old and still kicking, I started to really code when I joined HAMK, and figured out that i really enjoyed it and i wanted to get into the cloud space but soon i figured out that the AI space intrigued me so i may have joined a bit later than most but as the saying goes "Better late then never" :D
